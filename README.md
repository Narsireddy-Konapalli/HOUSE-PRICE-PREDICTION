## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **house price prediction model** using machine learning techniques. It analyzes real estate features like:
- **Bedrooms & Bathrooms**
- **Square footage** of living space & lot area
- **Year built & renovations**
- **Location (Latitude & Longitude)**
- **View, Condition, and Grade** of the house

The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit on Hugging Face Spaces** for real-time predictions.
