##  Project Overview
This project builds a **house price prediction model** using machine learning techniques. It analyzes real estate features like:
- **Bedrooms & Bathrooms**
- **Square footage** of living space & lot area
- **Year built & renovations**
- **Location (Latitude & Longitude)**
- **View, Condition, and Grade** of the house

The trained model is deployed using **Streamlit on Hugging Face Spaces** for real-time predictions.

##  Features
 Train and evaluate multiple **regression models**  
 **Hyperparameter tuning** for optimal performance  
 **Evaluation metrics:** R¬≤, RMSE, MAE  
 **Deployment on Hugging Face Spaces**  
 **Streamlit UI** for easy user interaction

##  Tech Stack
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning Models** (RandomForest, Gradient Boosting)
- **Streamlit** (for web UI)
- **Hugging Face Spaces** (for deployment)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control)
